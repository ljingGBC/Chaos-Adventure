## About the Project ##
This is a Single-Player 2D Role-Playing Game (RPG) project. The user plays as the protagonist and will have a wonderful experience in the game. The protagonist and his NPC friends will work together to find the secrets in the game world, defeat their enemies, and eventually become a hero.

The objective of the game is for the player to go through all the missions, defeat the enemies, get the items needed, and complete the game without getting killed and within the time limit.

## Key Features ##
### World Settings ###
The game is planned to be set for several chapters: each chapter has an independent world plot. Each world has its main missions for them to complete. 

* Independent World: The main world in the game was destroyed because of some unknown reasons. Time and space are in chaos: the different historic periods and different parallel worlds which have various civilization are connected to each other. There are three basic independent worlds: The Three Kingdoms of China, the Legend of King Arthur in Ancient Europe, and the Maya civilization. These worlds will be presented in different maps. The characters would go through these worlds and complete specific tasks.
